//! Gateway shutdown and recovery.
//!
//! Four functions manage the process lifecycle:
//!
//! - [`idle_monitor`] — polls [`crate::lifecycle::ActivityTracker`] and resolves
//!   when the gateway has been idle for `idle_timeout_secs`. Disabled (never
//!   resolves) when the timeout is zero. Defers shutdown if active turns are
//!   in flight, waiting up to one further `idle_timeout_secs` grace period
//!   before proceeding anyway.
//!
//! - [`graceful_shutdown`] — awaits SIGTERM or SIGINT. Pass this to axum's
//!   `serve().with_graceful_shutdown()` so the server stops accepting new
//!   connections while existing ones drain.
//!
//! - [`shutdown_active_turns`] — cancels every in-flight turn's
//!   `CancellationToken` and waits 500 ms for turn tasks to write partial
//!   responses before the process exits.
//!
//! - [`recover_orphaned_turns`] — runs once at startup to transition any turns
//!   left in an in-progress state by a previous unclean exit to `Interrupted`.
//!
//! Typical call sequence at shutdown:
//! ```text
//! tokio::select! {
//!     _ = graceful_shutdown() => {}
//!     _ = idle_monitor(state, timeout) => {}
//! }
//! shutdown_active_turns(&state).await;
//! ```
